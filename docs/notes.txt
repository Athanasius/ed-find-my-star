Purpose
=======

  Take a Right Ascension (RA), Declination (Dec) and if available
parallax/distance and determine where in the ED galaxy that should be.
Combined with lookups of names using simbad or similar this can allow
for finding a known real-world star in the ED galaxy.

Method
======

  Take RA/Dec and convert into (still polar) co-ordinates in the ED
galaxy frame of reference.

  Then apply any distance data to get approximate co-ordinates.

  Now lookup in EDSM/EDDB derived database to find candidates.
